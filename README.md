 - Sorting by ASC order of an array, sorted by ASC
 - Sorting by DESC order of an array, sorted by ASC
 - Sorting by ASC order of an array, sorted by DESC
 - Sorting by DESC order of an array, sorted by DESC

## How to run:
 - Download files from the repository

 - Enter array e.g. `6,4,-3,1,78,-56`
 - Enter order e.g. `asc` or `desc`
